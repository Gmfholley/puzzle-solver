# Solve puzzles

This repo solves a [Scramble Squares](https://www.amazon.com/B-Dazzle-Scramble-Squares-Kittens/dp/B000021Z0M) puzzle.  These puzzles are notoriously hard, with 9! * 4^9 possible solutions.

I tried and failed to solve this puzzle IRL, so I wrote this program. ğŸ˜…


The solution to my puzzle is:

```
----------SOLVED------------
----------Card 3------------
Map:
  o   |   G   |   G  
S   s | S   o | O   s
  G   |   c   |   C  
  g   |   C   |   c  
G   o | O   s | S   o
  C   |   g   |   G  
  c   |   G   |   g  
C   O | o   S | s   c
  S   |   C   |   o 

```


It can also solve more generic puzzles.

It solves the placement of n cards on a map of defined tesselating shapes, where the cards have half of an image on each edge, either the top or bottom half.
